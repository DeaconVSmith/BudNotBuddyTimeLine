# Generic_Timeline
Generic single HTML page timeline


This is a generic one page vertical timeline with events on both sides of a responsive line down the middle.

It can be easily stylized and color coded and the lorem ipsum text replaced with events for a timeline.

The timeline is responsive to smaller browser windows as well.
